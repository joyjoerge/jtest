# Person profile

My name is Caran Dâ€™Arche. I am a pencil, and I was born in Geneva. A few days after my birth, my family moved to Bangalore, where I went to school and college. I graduated top of my class from the Faber-Castell Architecture University, and interned as draughtsperson at Kohinoor Hardtmuth.
