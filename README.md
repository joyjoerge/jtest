# About Me

My name is Joy Myalil. I would like to say that I have always had a strong interest in sustainable farming and wanted to get my hands dirty, learning all about it. 

Farming isn’t as much a job as it is a lifestyle. It’s also a satisfying environment to work in. You can see the progress the crops make and watch over the welfare of the animals — everything you do has an effect.
