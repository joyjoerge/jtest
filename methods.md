# Methods in Organic Farming

## Crop diversity

Though people are still wary about it, there is now a big demand for organic produce. While in ancient times they practice what is called monoculture (cultivating one type of crop in a particular location), organic farmers of today go with polyculture, which allows them to cultivate a variety of crops simultaneously. This helps them address the demand for the organic produce.

## Soil management

After cultivating crops for weeks and sometimes, months, the soil will lose its natural nutrients and minerals. What organic farming does is not to use that soil immediately again, but to allow it to go back to tis natural health by using “natural ways”—organic wastes such as crop, animal and farm waste, and aquatic waste.

## Weed management

Weed grows unnaturally in agricultural fields, and most conventional farms would use chemicals to kill this unwanted plant. Organic agriculture barely allows the killing of anything produced naturally by the soil. Instead, it deals with weed by lowering them rather than removing them completely.

## Controlling organisms

Because organic farming is all about the natural way of the farmland, the growth of different organisms there can’t be helped. However, even organic farmers need to protect the soil and the crops from anything that might harm it in the future. They use herbicides and pesticides that contain less chemicals. The proper sanitation of the farm is also required.

## Domestic animals

An organic farm can be sustained by the presence of domestic animals. Remember that organic farmers use animal waste as natural fertilizers, so their existence in organic farms is highly needed.
